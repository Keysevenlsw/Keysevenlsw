### Hi my name is sevenlsw ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! 
I am a sophomore majoring in Software Engineering.
I have a strong passion for programming and enjoy playing table tennis in my free time.
I love exploring the unknown, whether it's the latest technology or little discoveries in everyday life.
If you share similar interests, I'd love to connect and chat!
